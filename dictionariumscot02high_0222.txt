Dictionary‚ under this word; Skene, in his
note on the first cited of the passages above,
in his Latin edition of our ancient laws, men·
tions it to have been “ Barbarum nomen pris-
cis Scotis et Hybernis usitatum pro Senjamlo,
vel serviente curiae, qui literas citatorias man-
dat exsecutioni :'’—while under the same word,
in his work De Ver-borum Sfflfflone, he
mentions it as an office, or jurisdictioni, ‘⁴ not
unlike ane Bailliary,’' and adds, “ specially in
the Highlands and Isles.” It is observ-able of
this office, that such grants of it as had then
been obser-ved, were only known to have ex-
isted, either in the Highlands, or in districts
where the Gaelic language is admitted to have
been spoken. Two such grants had fallen un-
der the observau'on of Skene himself: one, by
David 11. of the 'l'oiseadrachship of the Earl-
dom of Carrick, anciently a part of Galloway,
where the Gaelic tongue long subsisted, noticed
in his note on the first cited passage of the Ray.
qu.; the other, of the Toiseadrachship of Kin-
tyre, dated 9th March, 1554. and noted in his
treatise De Ver-h. Siquis: A similar grant of the
office for the district of Nithsdale is confirmed
'by a charter of Robert 111„ a district which
Chalmers‚ in his Caledonia, Vol. iii. p. 60„ ad-
verting to that charter, observes‚·fi-om its proxi-
mity to Galloway, to have early received an
influx of Scoto-Irish settlers. Two other
grants of this office, also in Highland districts,
have been lately discovered, and put upon re-
cord: one by the Earl of Ross and Lord of
the Isles‚ dated 20th April 1456, is of the
Toiseadrachship of Lochaber; and another by
the predecessor of the Dukes of Argyll, there-
in designed “ Dominus de Loch-awe,’' of the
Toiseadrachship of the district of Melford, and
certain other lands‚ as therein particularly de·
scribed. In this last, the remarkable permis-
sion, “ praedas facere, vel guerras suffocare ;”
though seemingly a great concession of power,
must be understood as merely signifying, to
distrain for fees and amercements ; and to
summon the king’s rebels to lay down their
arms.
